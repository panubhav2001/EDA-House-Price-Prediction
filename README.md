Hey everyone, I have performed EDA and applied kNN and DT on a dataset named 'Hosuing.csv'. The target variable is House price for this particular dataset. 
To understand the effect of dropping a feature, I compared the results after dropping one column and drew my conclusions. Feel free to share your thoughts on the same.
